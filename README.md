#Timelogger

This is a simple windows phone app that lets you clock work times. Two sessions per day are allowed.

You can then export a selected month to XLS, CSV formats to upload them to OneDrive or you can also format the clockings as text and send them as an e-mail.


##Compatibility

This app was originally developed for ```Windows Phone 7.5 Tango``` and was later upgraded to ```Windows Phone 8```. It has never been tested on ```Windows 10 Mobile```.
